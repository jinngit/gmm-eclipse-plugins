# GenMyModel Eclipse Plugins

You can find in this repository two plugins used to manage your GenMyModel project and compile/execute your GenMyModel custom generators from eclipse. These plugins can help you to easily develop your own custom generator. Once your custom generator is developed and you are happy with it, you can push it in github and enjoy it at any time, either from GenMyModel or from eclipse using these plugins.

### CustomGen Development Kit Features

The current features are supported:
* New custom generator creation in your eclipse environment
* Custom generator compilation (Acceleo script compilation and error report)
* Custom generator execution via run configurations

Planned features:
* Deployment in github repository
* Intermediate metamodels (auto) registration
* GenMyModel QVTo libraries

### GenMyModel Project Explorer Features

The current features are supported:
* Multi-accounts management (Addition/Suppression from Eclipse, not GenMyModel plateform)
* Projects visibility modification
